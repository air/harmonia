        I do not quite know how it happened, my recollection of the whole matter ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition.
        While hunting for some variety of plants in the mountains, I sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine.
        The ground suddently gave way all about me,
        precipitating me below. The fall was a very considerable oneâ€”probably thirty or forty feet, or more,
        and I was rendered unconscious.

        How long I lay there under the heap of earth and stones carried down in my fall
        it is impossible to say: perhaps a long time; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the debris,
        like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs.

        I found myself standing in an immense pit. It looked as if the solid earth
        had been indulging in some curious transformation during those moments of insensibility.
        I had a great mass of small fibrous rootlets tightly woven about
        my whole person, so that I was like a colossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered
        with wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had grown round me.

        Grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a dangerous accident, I set out walking along the
        edge of the ravine. For an hour or so I followed the valley in its many windings, but, failing to see any
        dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country.
        In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine.
        There was one large house in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not one solitary spire.
