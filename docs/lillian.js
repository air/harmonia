      Dear Miss Fuller,
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that you remember me after all this time. Uncle Jeffrey assured me
      that you will, no matter how long I wait, but that I should not write
      until I have something to say.
      I don't know if this news merits a letter, but I dare not wait much longer. I would
      not want you to be so old that you've forgotten me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grateful for our chance meeting. I would have had a very different life had you and
      Uncle not arrived at our community. (I know he is not my real Uncle, but that is what I call him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If not for you, I would not have been able to stay here and attend what is now Blithedale College. It
      is likely I would have attended no college at all. If it is one thing my unconventional
      upbringing has taught me, it is the importance of education.
      Uncle was adamant that I be part of the first graduating class.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may sound ungrateful, but I was saddened that once I came of age, he left—he did so fondly, but firmly.
      "There is so much here I need to see for myself," he said, in his mysterious way. He asked me to
      tell you that he'd fulfilled your request. He assured me you'd know what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should know he has passed on.  I was
      only a few years out of school and newly married; I stayed here to teach the next generation of girls.
      He had made it all the way to Wyoming—can you
      imagine! It has been years but I still miss him. His knowledge of the world seemed boundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, I have no family with whom to share my latest news, but for you. We have had our first child! It is a girl,
      and I have named her Abigail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know to what address I should post this letter, but Uncle had told me, with that familiar twinkle in his eye,
      to simply keep it safe and eventually you would read it. I don't see how this can be true,
      but as I said, he comprehended so many wonders.

      P.S.  I hope that you are able to come and see my daughter some time. She is so beautiful, and it would
      gladden my heart to show you the woman that I have become.
