      My whole mind was in a whirl, but out of the confusion, at length came a conclusion: I could no longer doubt that I,
      who had lived and died in the latter part of the nineteenth century, was alive and strong in the twentieth,
      a <ListCard author="lynn"
        expansions={["hundred years later"]}
        tag="brooks_years"
        card={<span>100 years also the time span in
          in <List tag="brooks_x"
            expansions={[["Cadwell's journal"], ["Cadwell's journal"]]} />â€”is this shorthand like a Biblical 40 years?
          
        </span>} />.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I could no more doubt than the consciousness that I was alive. Indeed, the impressions wrought into my being
      were much more real than those which I had just received from
      the strange scenes I had witnessed. I should not have been surprised to see them all disappear
      like the mirage of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>"But even then," I reflected, "I cannot doubt my own existence: <i>I am</i>.
      My dying prayer has been granted. This is the same world that I have lived in; but how changed!"
    </p>
  </div>
