      <p>
        Coined by Thomas More, <i>Utopia</i> (1516), utopian literature flourished
        in the late 19th century. Often intertwined with real-life intentional communities.
        Many stories are thin narrative window-dressing over socialist tractsâ€”heavy
        on excruciating detail about food production, civic engagement, gender politics.
      </p>
      <p>Students should come away with an understanding of the political landscapes
      that shaped utopian thinking, and be prepared to discuss their influence on later
      fantasy/science fiction/dystopian writing.
