        The term was first coined by Thomas More in <i>Utopia</i> (1516), but
        utopian literature truly flourished
        in the late 19th century. It often inspired or was inspired by real-life
        communes or intentional communities.
        Stories tend to be thin narrative window-dressing over socialist tractsâ€”heavy
        on detail about food production, civic engagement, and gender politics.
      </p>
      <p>Students should come away with an understanding of the political landscapes
      that shaped utopian thinking, and be prepared to discuss utopians' influence on later
      fantasy/science fiction/dystopian writing.
