            There was a rustle of garments and I opened my eyes. A fine looking man of perhaps sixty was bending over me. He was an utter stranger. I raised myself on an elbow and looked around the room. I certainly had never been in it before, or one furnished like it. "Where am I?" I demanded.
          </p>
          <p>
            "You have just been roused from a deep sleep, or, more properly, trance. May I ask you when you went to sleep?"
          </p>
          <p>
          "Why, last evening, of course, at about ten o'clock. I left my man Sawyer orders to call me at nine o'clock. What has become of Sawyer?"
        </p>
        <p>

          "I can't precisely tell you that," replied my companion, regarding me with a curious expression, "but I am sure that he is excusable for not being here. And now can you tell me a little more explicitly when it was that you fell into that sleep, the date, I mean?"
      </p>
      <p>
          "Why, last night, of course; I said so, didn't I? that is, unless I have overslept an entire day. Great heavens! that cannot be possible; and yet I have an odd sensation of having slept a long time. It was Monday, May 30th."
      </p>

      <p>
          "May I ask of what year?"
      </p>
      <p>
          I stared blankly at him, incapable of speech, for some moments.  "It was the year 1887," I said.
      </p>
      <p>
          "My dear sir," he said, "that you should be startled by what I shall tell you is to be expected; but I am confident that you will not permit it to affect your equanimity unduly. Your appearance is that of a young man of barely thirty, and your bodily condition seems not greatly different from that of one just roused from a somewhat too long and profound sleep, and yet this is the tenth day of September in the year 2000, and you have slept exactly one hundred and thirteen years, three months, and eleven days."

          I do not quite know how it happened, my recollection of the whole matter ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition.
          While hunting for some variety of plants in the mountains, I sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine.
          The ground suddently gave way all about me,
          precipitating me below. The fall was a very considerable oneâ€”probably thirty or forty feet, or more,
          and I was rendered unconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long I lay there under the heap of earth and stones carried down in my fall
          it is impossible to say: perhaps a long time; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the debris,
          like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found myself standing in an immense pit. It looked as if the solid earth
          had been indulging in some curious transformation during those moments of insensibility.
          I had a great mass of small fibrous rootlets tightly woven about
          my whole person, so that I was like a colossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered
          with wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had grown round me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a dangerous accident, I set out walking along the
          edge of the ravine. For an hour or so I followed the valley in its many windings, but, failing to see any
          dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of the surrounding country.
          In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine.
          There was one large house in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not one solitary spire.
