            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later. I didn't want her to get far, so I <ListCard tag="c7-ended" expansions={["ended class"]}

              I pulled Lillian aside and instructed her to talk to the librarian and collect any more stray journal entries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most students were still in lecture halls so it was easy to track Gilman as she hurried across the quad. She was dressed about the
              same as when I met her, except her hair was pulled back now, in a tightly wound bun. The weather had
              turned to icy rain again but the woman seemed impervious. I was feeling bold, so when she
              entered the English department offices, I grabbed the open door before she could close it.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hi, Alice!" I said. "I meant it when I said wanted to catch up after class."
            </p>
            <p>
              She stiffened and looked as if she wanted to escape. Two <ListCard
                expansions={["faculty members"]} tag="c7-faculty" card={<span>I recognized one who'd spurned me in
                the dining hall. I doubted they liked Gilman any more than they liked me.</span>} /> were
              in the halls; they paused, sensing tension.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was happy to have the audience. "Let's talk in Professor Lynn's office." I smiled. "At the Dean's request."
            </p>
            <p>Gilman was trapped and she knew it. I followed her down the hall. She unlocked and <List expansions={[["opened the door."],

          burglary: <div>
            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later and I let her go. There was a good chance she was headed to
              Lynn's office now and I'd just have to hope there was still material to find after she'd done a sweep.
              I'd just have to wait for her to leave, and anyway I needed time to figure out how one broke into an office.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished class, a little distracted, and took Lillian aside to tell her to meet with the librarian. "Obviously
              there were more pages from Cadwell's journal than Lynn found," I said. "See what else she hasn't cataloged yet."
            </p>
            <p>
              The weather had turned icy-wet again, so I bundled up and skulked out by the quad where I could get a
              good view of the English department. There were student protestors setting up tables and <ListCard expansions={["signs"]}

              someone had draped the little backhoe in origami birds and Tibetan prayer flags. One of the students
              handed me a flyer printed on cardstock, adorned with a sticker:

              Lynn's office now, but I was assuming she'd already removed the interesting material there anyway.
              Besides, I had a friend to visit.

              I finished class, a little distracted, and took Lillian aside to tell her my plan. "Just go to your

            <p>Her name was __ and she taught Creative Writing. Since she already knew who I was,

                offer to accompany me. I did accept a flashlight and a key to the storage crate

              The basement beneath the Center was modern, if unfinished, with multiple exits in all directions.
              A car-sized hole had been punched out of the
              concrete wall, revealing narrow earthen tunnel framed by timber. It was easy to forget that these
              utopians had no real machinery of any kindâ€”everything they built had to be done by hand. I put my
              palm up against one of the struts; it felt damp but strong.

            <p>
              There was some hand-penciled graffiti on one of the struts. I leaned in to <List expansions={[["examine"], ["examine"]]}

              all over the Science Center now."

            <p>
              The student glanced at me, probably looking for support, but I was as confused as she was. While I stood there

              Lillian and I exchanged a look, but said nothing.

              I was startled by the door to Lynn's office unlocking and opening. I didn't have time to
              even consider hiding before Lillian and <Map from={inventory.c2_direction}

              "How did you get in?" I said.

                                She eyed the open window. "Unless that would spoil the adventure.</span>}} />

                                  <p>"This is Ms. Merchant," Lillian said, in a tone that suggested I should've known this.</p>
                                  <p>"You're the librarian?" I said.</p>
                                  <p>"Archivist." She eyed the open window and my flushed appearance. "You know if you ever need to get anywhere
                                    in the school, just ask." She paused. "I'll probably say yes."</p>

            <p>I gave the papers to Lillian and asked Ella, "Do you know where Lynn lived?"</p>
            <p>"<ListCard expansions={["Adams House"]} tag="c7_house"
              card={<span>The five extant utopian homes were named after the families who had built them.</span>} />," she said. The name didn't mean anything to me.</p>
            <p>"Wait, really?" Lillian said.</p>
            <p>I looked between them. "What's that?"</p>
            <p>"It's right on campus," Lillian said. "One of the original stone Futurian buildings."</p>
            <p>"I don't have keys to people's homes," Ella said.</p>
            <p>"Sure," I said. "But does his home have a window?"</p>
