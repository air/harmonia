            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later but the students didn't object when I cut class a few minutes short.
              I quietly told Lillian to talk to the librarian and sweep up any more journal entries she might've found.
              As I left the room I heard Charlotte say to a friend, "Well, that was pretty weird."
            </p>
            <p>
              The quad was empty and it was easy to follow Gilman as she stalked across it. She was dressed about the
              same as when I met her, except her hair was pulled back now, in a tightly wound bun. The weather had
              turned back to icy rain again but the woman seemed impervious. I didn't bother waiting behind as she
              entered the English department offices and grabbed the open door before it swung shut.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hi, Alice!" I said. "I meant it when I said wanted to catch up after class."
            </p>
            <p>
              She spun around, her eyes darting from side-to-side as if looking to escape. Several <ListCard
                expansions={["faculty"]} tag="c7-faculty" card={<span>I recognized one who'd spurned me in
                the dining hall. I doubted they liked Gilman any more than they liked me.</span>} /> were
              in the halls; a few paused, sensing tension.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was happy to have the audience. "Let's talk in Professor Lynn's office." I smiled. "At the Dean's request."
            </p>
            <p>Gilman was trapped and she knew it. She unlocked and <ListCard expansions={[["opened the door."],
            ["opened the door, and then we were alone."]]} tag="c7_opendoor" /></p>
          </div>,
          burglary: <div>
            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later and I let her go. There was a good chance she was headed to
              Lynn's office now and I'd just have to hope there was still material to find after she'd done a sweep.
              I'd just have to wait for her to leave, and anyway I needed time to figure out how one broke into an office.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished class, a little distracted, and took Lillian aside to tell her to meet with the librarian. "Obviously
              there were more pages from Cadwell's journal than Lynn found," I said. "See what else she hasn't cataloged yet."
            </p>
            <p>
              The weather had turned icy-wet again, so I bundled up and skulked out by the quad where I could get a
              good view of the English department. There were student protestors setting up tables <ListCard expansions={["signs"]}
                tag="c7-tables"
                card={<span>"Rally tomorrow: rain or shine!"</span>} /> by the meteorite;
              someone had draped the little backhoe in origami birds and Tibetan prayer flags. One of the students
              handed me a flyer printed on cardstock, adorned with a sticker:

            <p>After a cold and damp wait, I saw Gilman exit the building through a rear door and disappear behind
            the gymnasium. I made my move.</p>
            <p>
              It was late afternoon now, and many faculty members were packing up to drive home or down to the village.

              dining hall visits. "Oh,
              are you Abby Fuller?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>Her name was __ and she taught Creative Writing. Since she already knew who I was,
              I didn't bother with the long implausible story
              I'd been formulating in case I was caught, and simply said I'd lost Lynn's key.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm afraid all the locks are different so my key won't help," she said, and then added, slyly, "But the windows don't lock at all."</p>
            <p>Minutes later I was murmuring thanks to 20th century building codes, and dropped into Lynn's office through
            a window off the fire escape.</p>
            <p>
              "Nice meeting you," I heard her yell out. "<ListCard expansions={["Call me"]}

            <p>Lynn's office was a mess now. The neat stacks of paper were pooled on the floor, all sense of
              order destroyed. I assumed Gilman had been through these as thoroughly as I could be, so I
              started looking in places she hadn't checked: <List expansions={[["behind cabinets", "under desks", "in drawers"],

              I found what I was looking for in the <FromInventory from={inventory.c7_search} />, hidden inside
              some <ListCard expansions={["library books"]} tag="c7_library" card={<span>Now quite overdue.</span>} />:
              two journal entries, heavily annotated by Lynn himself:

              Lynn's annotations were undated, but this seemed to be an early find. The second set of notes were
              obviously made more recently:

              I was startled by the door to Lynn's office unlocking and opening. I didn't have time to
              even consider hiding before Lillian and <Map from={inventory.c2_direction}

                                    in the school, just ask." She paused. "I'll probably say yes."</p>

              "We didn't find any more journal entries," Lillian said. "Though it looks like you did."
            </p>
            <p>I gave the papers to Lillian and asked Ella, "Do you know where Lynn lived?"</p>
            <p>"<ListCard expansions={["Adams House"]} tag="c7_house"
              card={<span>The five extant utopian homes were named after the families who had built them.</span>} />," she said. The name didn't mean anything to me.</p>
            <p>"Wait, really?" Lillian said.</p>
            <p>I looked between them. "What's that?"</p>
            <p>"It's right on campus," Lillian said. "One of the original stone Futurian buildings."</p>
            <p>"I don't have keys to people's homes," Ella said.</p>
            <p>"Sure," I said. "But does his home have a window?"</p>
