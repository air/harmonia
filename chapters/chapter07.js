            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later but the students didn't object when I cut class a few minutes short.
              I quietly told Lillian to talk to the librarian and sweep up any more journal entries she might've found.
              As I left the room I heard Charlotte say to a friend, "Well, that was pretty weird."
            </p>
            <p>
              The quad was empty and it was easy to follow Gilman as she stalked across it. She was dressed about the
              same as when I met her, except her hair was pulled back now, in a tightly wound bun. The weather had
              turned back to icy rain again but the woman seemed impervious. I didn't bother waiting behind as she
              entered the English department offices and grabbed the open door before it swung shut.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hi, Alice!" I said. "I meant it when I said wanted to catch up after class."
            </p>
            <p>
              She spun around, her eyes darting from side-to-side as if looking to escape. Several <ListCard
                expansions={["faculty"]} tag="c7-faculty" card={<span>I recognized one who'd spurned me in
                the dining hall. I doubted they liked Gilman any more than they liked me.</span>} /> were
              in the halls; a few paused, sensing tension.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was happy to have the audience. "Let's talk in Professor Lynn's office." I smiled. "At the Dean's request."
            </p>
            <p>Gilman was trapped and she knew it. She unlocked and <ListCard expansions={[["opened the door."],
            ["opened the door, and then we were alone."]]} tag="c7_opendoor" /></p>

          burglary: <div>
            <p>Gilman slipped out moments later and I let her go. There was a good chance she was headed to
              Lynn's office now and I'd just have to hope there was still material to find after she'd done a sweep.
              I needed time to figure out how one broke into an office.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished class, a little distracted, and quietly told Lillian to meet with the librarian. "Obviously
              there were more pages from Cadwell's journal than Lynn found," I said. "See what else she hasn't cataloged yet."
            </p>
            <p>
              The weather had turned icy-wet again, so I bundled up and skulked out by the quad where I could get a
              good view of the English department. There were student protestors setting up <ListCard expansions={["tables and signs"]}
                tag="c7-tables"
                card={<span>"Rally tomorrow: rain or shine!"</span>} /> by the meteorite;
              someone had draped the little backhoe in origami birds and Tibetian prayer flags. One of the students
              handed me a flyer printed on sepia cardstock, adorned with a sticker:

            <p>After a cold and damp wait, I saw Gilman exit the building through a rear door and disappear behind
            the gymnasium. I made my move.</p>
            <p>
              It was late afternoon now, and many of the English faculty were packing up to drive home or down to the village.

            <p>This time the noise attracted a woman in the office across the hall. I didn't <ListCard tag="c7_reminded"
              expansions={["recognize"]} card={<span>Though she had a surprisingly strong working-class Boston accent that reminded me of home.</span>} /> her from any of my
              dining hall visits. "Oh,
              are you Abby Fuller?" she asked.
            </p>
            <p>Her name was __ and she taught Creative Writing. Since she knew who I was I dropped the long implausible story
              I'd been formulating in case this happened, and simply said I'd lost Lynn's key.
            </p>
            <p>"I'm afraid all the locks are different," she said, and then added, slyly, "But the windows don't lock at all."</p>
            <p>Breathing a little prayer of thanks to 20th century building codes, I dropped into Lynn's office through
            a narrow window just off the fire escape.</p>

              "Nice meeting you," I heard her say. "<ListCard expansions={["Call me"]}

            <p>Lynn's office was a mess now. The neat stacks of paper were pooled on the floor, all sense of
              order destroyed. I assumed Gilman had been through these as thoroughly as I could be, so I
              started looking in places she hadn't checked: <List expansions={[["behind cabinets", "under desks", "in drawers"],
