      I'd driven a hundred miles for this job and now I was late to my first class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve young women, seated in neat
      rows, stared back at me.
      I dropped my armful of papers on the lecturn and most of them slid off and fanned
      out onto the floor. I brushed my hair out of my face.
    </p>
    <p>"Welcome to <i>Nineteenth Century Utopian Literature</i>," I began.</p>
    <p>"Can't hear you," said someone in the back.</p>
    <p>"Right, sorry." I coughed. "Welcome to <i>Nineteenth Century Utopian Literature</i>.

      Their undivided attention was disconcerting; I'd never led a class myself, much less a class of exquisitely bred
      Yankee daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also had no idea what material Lynn had already covered or even <ListCard expansions={["how many classes"]}

    <p>"Charlotte," she said. She was impeccably dressed, her hair perfect; she was

    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Utopian Literature," I began again.
      "The term was first used as the title of Thomas More's 1561 work, <i>Utopia</i>."

      notes that <i>Utopia</i> was actually published in 1516."</p>
    <p>"Yes, fine, sorry." Now I was flustered. "Did Professor Lynn already cover this material?"</p>
    <p>Many heads nodded. I looked back down at the syllabus I'd thrown together
    this morning:</p>

      Lillian again: "We were supposed to start on Bellamy this week." She paused, and considered me for a moment.
      "I did the reading and I could summarize it now?"
    </p>

      The campus, which had seemed unwelcoming in the dead of night, was actually quite pleasant.
      It was laid out along one slope of the Berkshire foothills, in an area once cleared for
      agriculture but now largely forested.
      Almost every spot on campus afforded gorgeous views down into the valley:
      a rolling canopy punctuated by chimneys and whitewashed steeples. The nearest village, where most of the
      staff lived, was situated at the base of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The largest area of level ground was the grassy central quadrangle, and many of the
      campus buildings, including my residence, faced out onto it.
      Most structures were ivy-covered brick, though a few small ones were made of rougher gray stone
      splashed with pastel lichen and moss.
    </p>
    <p>A clock somewhere chimed noon and students poured out of the
      buildings, <ListCard expansions={["trudging"]}
        tag="c3-steps"
        card={<span>It was popular to arrange one's schedule such that each subsequent

    </p>
    <p>
      I drifted into the quad.
      Footpaths through the grass all veered
      around a central clearing, where a stepped viewing platform encircled a curious <List expansions={[["stone peak"], ["stone peak"]]}
                                                                                        tag="c2-astrolith" />:

      It was an inky black boulder, a dozen meters around the base and pointed like a pint-sized mountain. There were bumps and cavities
      across its surface which had been smoothed by age.  I stooped to read
      a small nearby <List expansions={[["plaque"], ["plaque"]]} tag="c3_plaque" />:

  <blockquote className="sign">
    <h4>THE "ASTROLITH"</h4>
    <p>
      This very large ataxite meteorite formed the centerpiece of the Harmonian community,
      who christened it the "Astrolith" and believed it imbued their village with "Scientific Vitality."
    </p>
    <p>It was originally enclosed by the so-called Phalanstery,
      a large, multi-story communal hall.  The hall's destruction by fire in 1889 precipitated the end of the community but
      the Astrolith was undamaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circular seating was added in 1931 by the gift of an anonymous donor.
      The meteorite is estimated to weigh 30 tons, though it has never been fully excavated.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Beneath that, a typewritten addendum was tucked into a weathered plastic sleeve:
  </p>
  <blockquote className="typewritten">
    PLEASE NOTE:
    As part of the Science Center expansion, the Astrolith will
    be extracted and relocated to the Museum of Science in Boston.
    We apologize for any inconvenience.

  <p>
    And scrawled on <i>that</i> was some <List expansions={[["graffiti"], ["graffiti"]]}

    A trail of construction equipment lead uphill to a dreary concrete building marked SCIENCE CENTER.
    One wing of the building
    looked brand new, its gray blocks gleaming but no less ugly. A backhoe was parked nearby,
    lying in wait.
  </p>
  <p>
    A paved path ran between the meteorite and the largest building on campus, where the administrative staff worked.
    More importantly, the dean worked there, and she'd told me to check in as soon as I <ListCard expansions={["arrived"]}
      tag="c2-arrived"
      card={<span>Since that was the middle of the night, I hadn't yet had the chance.</span>}/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Amid the students coming and going from the Science Center, I recognized the <ListCard expansions={["odd woman"]}
      tag="c2_woman"
      card={<span>I wanted to thank her, and ask her for the keys to Lynn's office
      and his teaching material.</span>} /> who
    had let me in the building last night. She paused at the entrance to the building, looked around as if
    she didn't want to be seen, and disappeared inside.

  </p>
  <p>
    I hesitated, torn between <List expansions={[["following my curiosity", "meeting with the dean"], ["following my curiosity", "meeting with the dean"]]}
                                tag="c2_direction" />.

        <p>The atrium of the Science Center was only partially finished, still
          swathed in plastic sheeting and warning tape, with sawdust everywhere. The floor was covered by layers of protective
          tan paper, dirtied by boot marks from workers.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't see the woman so I followed the path of heaviest footprints down the hallway.
          The newer rooms seemed to be
          unfinished labs and other functional spaces, with cabling dangling from unpanelled ceilings. Walls and chairs
          and benches were all sharp-edged and bright white, in contrast to the ivy-league aspirations of
        the rest of the campus.</p>
        <p>The hall turned back on itself in a U-shape, towards the quad, ending in a fireproof stairwell. The stairs
          leading up were incomplete. The stairs leading down were crisscrossed with
          tape and "No Admittance" signs, but if I just reached out and <List expansions={[["lifted the tapeâ€”"], ["liftedâ€”"]]} tag="c2_cellar" />

        <p>
          The administration building was a grand old brick edifice, fronted with tidy columns and an oversized door.
          The entry hall was obviously designed to impress parents and donors and was dominated by a majestic curved
          stairwell with elaborate banisters and railings. Directly next to the stairs, a doorway was flanked by
          a freestanding brass sign that read, "Current Exhibit." I leaned in and knocked on the open door.
        </p>
        <p>
          An older woman with jet black hair and a kindly face was placing some manuscripts
          into a glass-topped display case and didn't seem
          to hear the knock. "Excuse me,"
          I said, as quietly as possible, and she jumped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sorry to have startled you! I'm Abby Fuller, I'm substituting for Jeffrey Lynn."

          The showy exhibit room, probably the first stop on any campus tour, was painted goldenrod and decorated
