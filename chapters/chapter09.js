        I looked down around me, and saw signs of modern intrusion: several plastic milkcrates, a flashlight, a few
        empty bags of potato chips. The milkcrates were stuffed full of
        notebooks and papers and as I knelt down, flashlight stuck under one arm, I almost wept with joy.
        I'd been collecting these one-by-one in a scavenger hunt and here was a small library.

        One crate was entirely full of issues of <i>The Circular</i>. Lynn had <List expansions={[["annotated"], ["annotated"]]}
                                                   tag="c9_paper" /> one on top, from late in the colony's history:

    </section>,
    <section>
      <Reader inventory={inventory} docs={[docs.paper4]}/>
    </section>
